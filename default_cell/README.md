Default Cell
=========

Adds and runs a default cell at the top of each new notebook. To change the default cell, edit the `add_cell` function in the `main.js` file. The relevant section is:

`Jupyter.notebook.insert_cell_above('code').set_text(``)`

Set the `text` to the default notebook cell you would like.

This extension also adds a button to the toolbar allowing you to insert and run the
default cell above your current cell. This can be helpful if you open an already started notebook
and notice you are missing some common imports.

This extension is a work in progress and any help would be appreciated. Feel free to make contributions
